Just playing around with the Spotify API

Created with React and TypeScript

Clean Start:

```rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install && npm start```

Add .env variables with ``REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`` and ``REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI``

[Set up your environment variables](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)

this is a WIP!
